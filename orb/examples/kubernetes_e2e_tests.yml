  This is an example of how one might run an end-to-end
  test in Kubernetes using this Orb. There are two entrypoints
  for scripts here, one is a pre_script, and one is the script.
  The pre_script runs on the CircleCI executor itself and allows
  access to the repository that was checked out, as well as provides
  the opportunity to copy more files over to the command runner. This
  can be done using `docker cp <file> e2e-command-runner:<path>.
  The regular script is copied over to the command runner container
  and executed on the command runner, providing access to the
  Kubernetes kind cluster via kubectl and helm commands. The
  post_script runs on the CircleCI executor itself after the script
  is run on the command runner.
