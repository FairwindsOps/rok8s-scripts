# Kubernetes Scripts

Opinionated scripts for managing application development and deployment lifecycle using Kubernetes.

## How to Install

```
npm install rok8s-scripts
export PATH="$(PWD)/node_modules/.bin:$PATH"
```

Then in your top-level project directory:
```
k8s-example-config
```

## Examples

Explore the `examples/` directory for example files.

## Config file

k8s-scripts all function based on a simple bash config file in the root of your project directory named 'k8s-scripts.config'.

```
# Dockerfile to build
DOCKERFILE='Dockerfile'

# Docker tag that will be created
DOCKERTAG='quay.io/exampleorg/example-app'

# Cluster Namespace to work in
NAMESPACE='default'

# List of files ending in '.configmap.yml' in the kube directory
CONFIGMAPS=()

# List of files ending in '.secret.yml' in the kube directory
SECRETS=('example-app')

# List of files ending in '.secret.sops.yml' in the kube directory

```

### Generating a config

There is a `k8s-example-config` script that will output an example config for you.

`k8s-example-config`
Outputs an example config to k8s-scripts.config

`k8s-example-config -o k8s-scripts.prod.config`
Outputs an example config to the filename specified by -o flag.

### Supporting multiple environments

All scripts take an `-f configfile` option that allows you to specify which configuration file to use.

We recommend having the default, k8s-scripts.config, setup for your minikube environment, then
specify `<env>.conf` for each of your environments.

## deploy directory

Your kubernetes API object files should all be stored in the /deploy top level directory using consistent naming:

* Deployments end in `deployment.yml`
* Secrets end in `secret.yml`
* ConfigMaps end in `configmap.yml`
* Persistent Volumes end in `persistent_volume.yml`
* Persistent Volume Claims end in `persistent_volume_claim.yml`
* Statefulsets end in `statefulset.yml`
* Services end in `service.yml`
* Blocking Jobs end in `blockingjob.yml`
* Jobs end in `job.yml`
* Ingress Resources end in `ingress.yml`
* Pod Disruption Budgets end in `pod_disruption_budget.yml`

## Credentials

If you are using `rok8s-scripts` to deliver images to a cloud repository on AWS or GCP you will need to provide credentials as enviconrment variables. `rok8s-scripts` will automatically login if the following variables exist:

### AWS [Access Keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)
* `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
* `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

### GCP
* `GCLOUD_KEY` [Service Account Keys](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys)

## Kubernetes Access

In order to connect to a Kubernets cluster the build must authenticate. In GKE clusters having the above GCP login is sufficient. In other clustuers, base64encode your kube_config file and save it in the environment variable `KUBECONFIG_DATA`


## Commands

### docker-build

Does a build of the current directory
`docker build --rm=false -t $DOCKERTAG -f ${BASEDIR}/$DOCKERFILE ${BASEDIR}``

### docker-pull

Pulls from the registry the most recent build of the image. Useful for CI/CD layer caching

### docker-push

Pushes the recently built image to the registry.

This requires the environment variables:

* `EXTERNAL_REGISTRY_BASE_DOMAIN`
* `REPOSITORY_NAME`
* `DOCKERTAG`
* `CI_SHA1`
* `CI_BUILD_NUM`

And either `CI_BRANCH` or `CI_TAG`

### k8s-deploy

`kubectl apply`'s files in the config.

**If a Docker image is used in the file then any cases of `:latest` will be replaced with th `CI_SHA1` if it is defined.** This allows a set image tag to be used when deploying from a CI system. When files that could use `CI_SHA1` is are deployed, a new file will be created with that value as part of the filename.

Leverages kubernetes annotations with `--record` when creating objects.

If using an HPA, set `replicas: hpa` in the deployment file to have k8s-deploy get the current number of replicas from the cluster and deploy that number of replicas. This is a workaround for an open issue (https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/25238).

### k8s-verify

Verifies your deployment was successful within a specified timeout.

### k8s-deploy-and-verify

Combines `k8s-deploy` and `k8s-verify` into a single command. This can be used to keep a smaller script/deployment config and for backwards compatibility.

### k8s-delete

Nukes everything defined in your k8s-scripts config file.

### k8s-lint

Linter to provide quick feedback on files. This should be used as part of your CI testing to lint on each build to discover problems before they stop a deployment.

Example:

```
k8s-lint -f k8s-scripts.config
```

Will exit non-zero on a failure.

Current checks:

* Files referenced in config file exist (does not check for secrets files)
* Deployments contain a `revisionHistoryLimit`

### k8s-secrets-from-s3

Generates a kubernetes secrets YAML file from the contents of a path within an S3 bucket. This will copy files from `${S3_BUCKET}/${NAMESPACE}/${SECRET}` and generate a file into `deploy/${SECRET}.secret.yaml`, suitable for deployment with `k8s-deploy`.

This script assumes that [`aws-cli`](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awscli) is installed and that AWS credentials with appropriate permissions are available to the CLI.

Example permissions:

```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Action": [
              "s3:Get*",
              "s3:List*"
          ],
          "Resource": [
            "arn:aws:s3:::${S3_BUCKET}",
            "arn:aws:s3:::${S3_BUCKET}/*"
          ]
      }
  ]
}
```

Secrets across clusters in the same namespace are not easily supported with this method as cluster names are not used. If you need to use the same namespace across different clusters (`kube-system` for example) then you should create separate buckets.

Each file in `${S3_BUCKET}/${NAMESPACE}/${SECRET}` will be a single entry in the Kubernetes Secret `${SECRET}`

An S3 bucket layout of:

```
production/
  example-secret/
    username
    password
```

With the file `username` containing `example-username` and `password` containing `example-password` would generate a secret of

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: example-secret
data:
  username: example-username
  password: example-password
```

### k8s-sops-secret-decrypt

Given an [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms/) key id, decrypts a file which is a kubernetes secret YAML. The encrypted secret file is safe to store in git.

The script assumes [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops.git) is installed and the `SOPS_KMS_ARN` environment variable is set. Ensure your `circle.yml` installs sops. I.e. add, `go get -u go.mozilla.org/sops/cmd/sops` to the `dependencies` level.

If run from circleci, the script also assumes that the circleci IAM user has proper privileges to decrypt secrets using the set key.

An example IAM policy might look like this:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "circle-decrypt",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "kms:Decrypt",
                "kms:DescribeKey"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:kms:<region>:<accountId>:key/<key>"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

A procedure for _encrypting_ secrets with sops might look this this:

Encrypt [secret spec files](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) with [sops](https://github.com/mozilla/sops)
  eg. `sops --kms="<your kms key arn>" --encrypt mysecret.yaml` _



### minikube-build
Switches to the minikube kubectl context, builds a Docker image from your current directory within the minikube Docker environment.

### minikube-deploy
Switches the minikube kubectl context, then runs `k8s-deploy`

### minikube-delete
Switches to the minikube kubectl context and deletes
all of the objects associated with the k8s-scripts.config

### minikube-services
Switches to the minikube kubectl context and prints out the accessible ip:port
of any services defined in the config file that are accessible from your local machine

### minikube-services-all
Switches to the minikube kubectl context and prints all the accessible ip:port
of all services that are accessible from your local machine

### prepare-awscli
Uses `aws` to configure Docker to use ECR. This requires:

* `AWS_ECR_ACCOUNT_ID` - The account ID for the ECR account to use.
* `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` - The region to use
* Standard AWS credentials for `aws`

### prepare-gcloud
Uses `gcloud` to download and configure `kubectl`, configures Docker to use
Container Registry and sets the default GCP projecct. This requires:

* `CLUSTER_NAME` - The short name of the cluster as shown in the GKE dashboard
* `GCP_ZONE` - The zone of the cluster
* `GCP_PROJECT` - The GCP project name (as passed to `gcloud` with `--project`)
* `GCLOUD_KEY` - The base64-encoded service account credentials

### prepare-kubectl
Initializes the Kubernetes config to be used with kubectl using a base64-encoded
config file from the `KUBECONFIG_DATA` variable. If `KUBECONFIG_DATA` is defined
this script will `base64 --decode` and place the value into `KUBECONFIG` to be
used by kubectl.

To generate a `KUBECONFIG_DATA` value you can use `cat ~/.kube/config | base64`.

## Assumptions

* In your Deployment file, specify imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
* When using HPA in your Deployment file, the value of $DEPLOYMENT must match the deployment name or rok8s-scripts will not be able to determine the current number of replicas.
