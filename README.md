rok8s-scripts is a framework for building GitOps workflows with Docker and Kubernetes.
By adding rok8s-scripts to your CI/CD pipeline, you can build, push, and deploy your applications using the
set of best practices we've built at Fairwinds.

In addition to building Docker images and deploying them to Kubernetes, rok8s-scripts is a great way to handle
secure secrets management, environment specific configuration, Docker build caching, and much more.
