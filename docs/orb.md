# Orb

CircleCI has introduced the concept of reusable config in the form of [Orbs](https://circleci.com/orbs/).  As of rok8s-scripts v9.0.0, Fairwinds publishes an orb called [`fairwinds/rok8s-scripts`](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/fairwinds/rok8s-scripts) in order to provide easier configuration inside of CircleCI.
