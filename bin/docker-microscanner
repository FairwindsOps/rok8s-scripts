# docker-microscanner **BETA RELEASE**
# This script helps you run your recently built docker images through the Aqua Microscanner.
# **NOTE** that this script can only be used _AFTER_ `docker-build` has run, and the image needs to be accessible still.
# This scanner will, be default, fail when detecting any high severity CVEs.
#
# Relevant Environment Variables
# - ENABLE_MICROSCANNER="true" (all other values are false)
# - MICROSCANNER_TOKEN="tokenHere" (see https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner#registering-for-a-token for a token)
# - MICROSCANNER_ARGS="--some-args" (see https://github.com/aquasecurity/microscanner for arguments)
# - MICROSCANNER_IMAGE_SOURCE="${DOCKERTAG}" (Defaults to DOCKERTAG, but you can override in case you don't have a local build but want to scan something in a repository. Can be helpful if your docker build don't persist through build steps.)
#
# Common issue - if your container does not have ca-certificates installed you can pass `MICORSCANNER_ARGS="--no-verify"`
#                to avoid checking certs for the scan. The error you may see is an x509 cert error:
#                - `x509: failed to load system roots and no roots provided`

  # Quick outline of how this works:
  # We start a heredoc and we plan to pipe the output of `cat <heredoc>`
  # to `docker build`, which will render the docker build from stdin.
  # TODO: Make this more efficient by using multi-stage build binary downloads
  #       from an existing image with the microscanner binary.
